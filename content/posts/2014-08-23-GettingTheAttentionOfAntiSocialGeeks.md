I was reading [Tim Bray's](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/) blog today and he
mentions that at OSCON this year there was a company booth which was capturing
the attention of
[anti-social geeks](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2014/07/30/OSCON-rear-view)
in a novel way.

This is a really interesting trick and I can count myself in that group of
*anti-social geeks* often. I saw another company doing this at the O'Reilly
Velocity conference earlier this year.
