Context switching is the productivity killer. Every time I have to reach for the
trackball while I'm engrossed in a task that requires the keyboard, I lose
whatever focus I had on that task. The few fractions of a second that it takes
to reach the trackball are irrelevant. The change in context is the actual
killer of my productivity.

That's one reason why I love Emacs and won't use any other text editor. Emacs is
a modeless text editor and you can accomplish any task in it by using certain
key chords in your keyboard, which translates to a completely mouse free
experience. I have spent much time thinking about how to translate the Emacs
experience to the whole graphical user interface paradigm and the answer has
been staring me in the face the whole time.

So the question has been _"How can I be most efficient in a graphical desktop
environment?"_ and I have known that the answer was to get rid of the mouse
since I started using Emacs several years ago. But how do you do that... The
pillar of the desktop paradigm is the pointing device. I think I found the
answer and it's a type of utility called the
_[Application Launcher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_application_launchers)_.

My recent epiphany was pure luck: Windows 7 does away with the Quick Launch
toolbar as I known it up to Windows Vista. In retrospect, the quick launch
toolbar paradigm couldn't be more inefficient: miniscule 16 by 16 pixel icons
lined up on a toolbar that's not much bigger. Talk about a violation of
[Fitt's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitt%27s_Law). I was too addicted to
the quick launch paradigm to be able to accept and use anything else, but
Windows 7 forced me to find an alternative.

Launcher tools have been around for a while and the first time I heard of them
was in an article about
[QuickSilver](http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver) for OS
X. There are definitely variations on the application launcher theme and I even
installed [Gnome Do](http://do.davebsd.com/) on a Linux laptop I had laying
around a little while back. So I installed [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/)
(it seems to be the most popular launcher for Windows) on my Windows 7 work
laptop and decided to give it a real try.

It took about an hour of using Launchy on my work laptop running Windows 7 to
shift to the _Application Launcher_ paradigm and be amazed at the results. It's
been a few days and I am still learning all that Launchy can offer, but one
thing is certain: there is a great likelihood that Launchy will completely
change the way I work and interact with a computer from now on.

There is a small amount of configuration and setup that you can do to Launchy to
teach it where to look for your stuff. Launchy has a concept of a _Catalog_,
which is a collection of locations and file types that it will look at when you
want to accomplish something.  If Launchy is missing a feature you need, you are
empowered to write your own Launchy plugin and fix your problem right then and
there.

Launchy also uses a _Verb/Subject_ analogy to accomplish useful things. For
instance, use the _Alt_ and _Spacebar_ keystroke to bring up Launchy, then type
in _"fire"_ for _Firefox_ and hit the _Tab_ key. Then type in the URL
_twitter.com_ and hit _Enter_. This launches Firefox on twitter.com. You can do
the same thing to open a file in Emacs. And you never leave the keyboard.

I am sure there are ways to activate the Quick Launch toolbar in Windows 7, but
I'm glad that I decided to give a Launchy a real try. I am pleasantly surprised
by the results so far.
