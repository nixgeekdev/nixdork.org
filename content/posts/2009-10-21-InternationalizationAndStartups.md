[Patrick Collison](http://collison.ie/) (of [Auctomatic](http://auctomatic.com/)
fame) wrote up a [post](http://collison.ie/blog/2009/10/surprises) about what
surprised him the most about doing his own startup. Here's a small pearl of
wisdom from that post that resonated with me:

This is such a no brainer, yet you see very few startups courting international
markets. Sure, there may be certain local regulations to abide by in certain
markets, but most of the social stuff startups put out there today will not
raise the eyebrows of most regulatory agencies in the western hemisphere. Case
in point is [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com/)... Have you heard of them? They are
huge in Brazil.

The other issue that comes to mind regarding internationalization is payment
processing. If you accept credit cards for your services, this is generally a
non-issue as rates are exchanged automatically. You will probably have to deal
more with the domestic credit card companies trying to minimize fraud than you
will have to deal with any particular issues from international customers. Also,
if you are selling a physical good, then shipping internationally is not really
that different than shipping domestically.

Anyway, I thought it was a great insight that got me to do some thinking of my
own...
