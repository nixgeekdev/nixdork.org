A *List Comprehension* is a type of set notation in which the programmer can
describe the properties that the members of a set must meet. It is usually used
to create a set based on other, already existing, set or sets by applying some
type of combination, transform or reduction function to the existing set(s).

Consider the following problem: You have a sequence of 10 numbers from 0 to 9
and you need to extract all the even numbers from that sequence. In a language
such a C# version 1.1, you were pretty much confined to the following code to
solve this problem:

    ArrayList evens = new ArrayList();
    ArrayList numbers = Range(10);
    int size = numbers.Count;
    int i = 0;

    while (i < size) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            evens.Add(i);
        }
        i++;
    }

The code above does not show the implementation of the `Range` function, which
is available in the full code listing below. With the advent of C# 3.0 and the
.NET Framework 3.5, a List Comprehension notation based on Linq is now available
to C# programmers. The above C# 1.1 code can be ported to C# 3.0 like so:

    IEnumerable<int> numbers = Enumerable.Range(0, 10);
    var evens = from num in numbers where num % 2 == 0 select num;

And technically speaking, the C# 3.0 code above could be written as a one-liner
by moving the call to `Enumarable.Range` into the Linq expression that generates
the `evens` sequence.  In the C# List Comprehension I am reducing the set
`numbers` by applying a function (the modulo 2) to that sequence.  This produces
the `evens` sequences in a much more concise manner and avoid the use of loop
syntax. Now, you may ask yourself: Is this purely syntax sugar? I don't know,
but I will definitelly investigate, and maybe even ask the question myself at
[StackOverflow][lnk1]. I suspect that this is not just syntax sugar and that
there are some true optimizations that can be done by utilizing the underlying
Monads.

I also posted this as [an answer to a question][lnk2] on
[StackOverflow.com][lnk1]. The full code listing is available below:
