Fascinating word: _Heuristics_. Some definitions follow.

**Heuristics:** Of or constituting an educational method in which learning takes
place through discoveries that result from investigations made by the student.

**Computer Science:** Relating to or using a problem-solving technique in which
the most appropriate solution of several found by alternative methods is
selected at successive stages of a program for use in the next step of the
program.

> A heuristic is a technique that helps you look for an answer. Its results are
> subject to chance because a heuristic tells you only how to look, not what to
> find. It doesn't tell you how to get directly from point A to point B; it
> might not even know where point A and point B are. In effect, a heuristic is
> an algorithm in a clown suit. It's less predictable, it's more fun, and it
> comes without a 30-day, money-back guarantee.
