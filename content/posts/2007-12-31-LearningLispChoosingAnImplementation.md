Six months ago I began to teach myself Lisp. The catalyst for me was the now
famous [quote](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) by Eric Raymond:

> LISP is worth learning for a different reason â€” the profound enlightenment
> experience you will have when you finally get it. That experience will make
> you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually
> use LISP itself a lot.

After reading this I couldn't help myself but to try Lisp.

I understand that the common knowledge in the Lisp community is that the current
obligatory initial text on Common Lisp is Peter Seibel's
[Practical Common Lisp](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Common-Lisp-Peter-Seibel/dp/1590592395/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1199166412&amp;sr=8-1).
However, during and after reading this tome, the common question I hear
beginners like myself ask is this: _What implementation of Common Lisp should I
use?

To the rescue comes Daniel Weinreb's
[survey](http://common-lisp.net/~dlw/LispSurvey.html) of all actively developed
Common Lisp implementations on the loose today. This is not an extensive survey,
but it gives you a pretty good idea of the capabilities of each
implementation. The last third of the survey's content gives the reader a great
list of Common Lisp resources. This is a must read for anyone learning Common
Lisp.
